# Path finding algorithms

This program should create or load a map, the map has the dimensions `nxn`
 defined by the user (or the file loaded). The program should allow the user to
 place obstacles in the map, as well as the beginning and end point.

The program needs to allow the user to save the map to a file, and show the way
 the path was found, its length and the total number of steps used.
